NOTES

CommandConnection will be implemented by IRCConnections and DCC connections

incomming strings will be assumed to have a user, command, and params in
 some form or fashion

IRCCommand's will work over ctcp and will fall into the order of RFC compliance

DCC chat commands will work over dcc and will be in the form
    .command params

OakCommand will pass call a methods like
    public void doCommand(CommandConnection con, String nick, String command, IRCLine params);
 to be parsed and acted upon

OakCommand will have a central entry point:
    public void doCommand(CommandConnection con, String nickMask, String command, IRCLine params);
 nickMask will be the as close to nick!user@host as possible if user cannot
 be obtained it must match the nick exactally host is the remote ip or host
 address of the connection.
